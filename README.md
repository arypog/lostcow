An interactive puzzle-adventure game built in Scratch.  
Your mission: **help a snail find its way home** by uncovering the correct sequence to reach the end.

## 🔮 Future Plans – Lost Cow 2 (3D Vulkan Edition? Maybe in OpenGL tho)

For **Lost Cow 2**, the idea is to completely reimagine the game in full 3D.  
I’m aiming for something with a vibe similar to the game shown in this video:

The core concept could remain the same, but idk yet.
